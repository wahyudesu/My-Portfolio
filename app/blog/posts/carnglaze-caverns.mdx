Me and my family went out for a trip to Carnglaze Caverns, where we explored its main cavern and enjoyed
our cups of coffee and hot chocolates.

Inside the cave you can find dimly lit natural pools amongst other small
trolls scattered around the place. There's also small posts with information
about the cave inside and its history regarding how it came to be.

I chose to have a pumpkin spiced latte (top right) and I approve! They have a lovely cabin-style cafe and outside area just
before the main cavern that makes for a great day out.
